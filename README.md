## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jonas Candido, and I'm exploring the world of technology to learn for fun and love. I would like to become a computer scientist and get a job in this area.
Nowadays I'm studying Java, Python, C, and MySQL, but I'm a great math enthusiast too :).

Also, I'd to share my profiles on other parts of the internet:
