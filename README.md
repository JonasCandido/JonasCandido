## Hi there 👋
My name is Jonas Candido, and I'm exploring the world of technology to learn for fun and love. I want to become a computer scientist and get a job in this area.
Currently, I'm studying Java, Python, C, Rust, Go, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, but I'm also a great math enthusiast.

Also, I'd like to share my profiles on other parts of the internet:
